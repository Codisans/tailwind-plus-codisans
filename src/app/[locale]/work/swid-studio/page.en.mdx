## The Partnership
Swid Studio is a creative force. Founded by Alicia Swiderski and Isabella Strand, the studio helps brands own their identity and express it boldly through thoughtful design, digital strategy, and storytelling.

But their vision was being held back — not by design, but by technology. They needed a CMS-powered website that could:

- Reflect their design quality without compromise
- Scale as their business grew
- Support future client work with full creative freedom

Enter Codisans.

What made this project special wasn’t just the result — it was the collaboration. Swid handled brand identity, sitemap, UI Kit, and all design assets. We handled the custom CMS build from the ground up — bringing their designs to life with performance, scalability, and pixel-perfect fidelity.

This project wasn’t a handoff. It was a creative handshake.

## The Challenge
Previously, Swid was working with a cookie-cutter template website. It didn’t reflect their premium design capabilities, and it restricted how they could present their work. They needed:

- A flexible CMS that allowed their team to manage content without relying on developers
- A fully custom front-end that aligned 1:1 with their brand
- A system that could grow with them — and support future custom site builds for their own clients

And above all — they needed a developer partner who wouldn’t restrict their design vision.

## The Solution: A Custom Statamic Build
We chose Statamic CMS for its flexibility, control, and performance — ideal for creative teams who need custom structures without a bloated backend or constant maintenance.

What we delivered:

- **Bespoke Front-End Build** - From typography to interaction details, we implemented Swid’s Figma designs with precision. Every visual decision was respected, every component intentional.
- **Custom CMS Architecture** - We created modular, easy-to-manage content blocks using Statamic’s flexible content builder. This gave the Swid team full control — no code required.
- **Optimized Performance** - The site is lightweight, fast, and SEO-friendly, with a clean codebase.
- **Client-Ready Infrastructure** - The architecture is now a model for future client projects: a custom CMS framework that supports rapid development while staying true to each brand's design system.

### Results
- **Seamless Designer-Developer Workflow** - Thanks to close collaboration, fast iterations, and clear boundaries, the project moved smoothly from design to production — without creative compromise.
- **Premium Web Presence** - Swid’s new site finally reflects the level of quality they deliver. Clean, expressive, and professional — the site is now an asset in closing high-caliber clients.
- **Reusable Model for Future Projects** - Swid now has a proven system for custom CMS projects, powered by a dev partner they trust.
