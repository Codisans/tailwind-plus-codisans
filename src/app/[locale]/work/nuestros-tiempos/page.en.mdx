## Vision: Using Technology to Decode Information Complexity

Chile's media ecosystem is one of the most active in Latin America — yet fragmented, politicized, and difficult to analyze at scale. Codisans saw an opportunity to address this fragmentation not through editorial control, but through engineering precision.

The mission behind Nuestros Tiempos was clear:

**Build an intelligent system capable of collecting, cleaning, and semantically analyzing Chile's entire digital news landscape — in real time.**

This required solving three technical challenges simultaneously:

- Multi-source scraping across heterogeneous websites with strict anti-bot protections.
- AI-based semantic similarity, to connect related articles without manual tagging.
- Real-time orchestration, to manage concurrent scraping, processing, and clustering at scale.

## System Architecture Overview

Nuestros Tiempos was designed as a full-stack AI platform built on a foundation of modern open-source technologies.

### 🧩 Core Stack

| Layer | Technologies | Purpose |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| Frontend | React 19 + TypeScript + Inertia.js + Tailwind v4 + Vite | Reactive SPA for live dashboards and visualizations |
| Backend | Laravel 12 (PHP 8.2) + Filament | Orchestrates scraping, embedding, and data APIs |
| Database | LibSQL (Vector Extension) + SQLite | Hybrid storage for structured and vectorized data |
| AI Layer | Ollama + BGE-M3 Model | Generates dense vector embeddings for semantic similarity |
| Scraping Engine | Puppeteer (stealth mode) | Bypasses anti-bot defenses, extracts clean article text |
| Infrastructure | Supervisor + Laravel Queues + Vite SSR | Handles concurrency, background jobs, and server rendering |

## Data Collection: Multi-Platform, Resilient Scraping

The platform ingests data from 16 major Chilean news outlets — from Emol and CNN Chile to CIPER and El Mostrador.

Each outlet has a custom configuration layer, defining unique CSS selectors, exclusion rules, and crawl rates. The Puppeteer stealth stack was enhanced with user-agent rotation, request throttling, and adaptive retries to ensure reliable scraping without violating robots.txt directives.

Selective Processing Pipelines sanitize HTML, remove ads, normalize character encoding, and extract metadata. Each article is then queued for embedding generation and stored in the vector database.

## AI Engine: Semantic Understanding through Vector Embeddings

Traditional keyword search fails to detect conceptual relationships between articles — e.g., "housing reform" and "urban planning." To solve this, Codisans integrated Ollama's BGE-M3 Model, a multilingual embedding model capable of capturing semantic similarity in Spanish-language text.

- For every processed article, the system computes a dense 768-dimension embedding.
- These vectors are indexed in LibSQL's vector storage, allowing cosine similarity queries to find thematically related articles.

**Example:**

When one outlet reports "Tax Reform Negotiations" and another covers "Fiscal Pact Debate," the AI engine clusters them under one collection — even with zero shared keywords.

This unsupervised clustering enables Nuestros Tiempos to auto-generate "intelligent collections" that reflect how Chilean media frames complex issues differently.

## Performance & Orchestration

Scalability was critical. The backend was optimized for concurrent processing using Laravel Queues and Supervisor workers, ensuring multiple scrapers could run in parallel without blocking API responses.

Performance enhancements include:

- **Database Indexing:** Composite indexes for fast retrieval of article metadata.
- **Rate-Limiting Logic:** Enforced polite crawling intervals per domain.
- **Queue Isolation:** Separate queues for scraping, embedding, and clustering tasks.
- **Caching Layer:** In-memory caching for high-frequency vector queries.
- **Server-Side Rendering:** Implemented via Vite SSR for SEO and shareable previews.

The entire architecture was deployed with zero-downtime reloads via Laravel Forge and systemd integration.

## Frontend: Interactive AI Dashboard

The frontend serves not only as a news viewer but also as a real-time control panel for the system.
Built in React 19 with TypeScript, the dashboard displays live scraping progress, vector clustering outputs, and AI-generated similarity metrics.

Users can visualize:

- Article embeddings in multi-dimensional projection.
- Cross-source relationship graphs.
- Time-based evolution of clusters (e.g., how different outlets cover the same event over days).

This transparency reinforces Nuestros Tiempos' mission of "trust through visibility."

## Ethical and Legal Engineering

From inception, Codisans integrated ethical scraping protocols — respecting rate limits, including source attribution, and omitting full-text republication.
Each collection links back to its original media outlet, maintaining both compliance and credibility.

This attention to legal and moral responsibility sets Codisans apart from generic scrapers: Nuestros Tiempos was engineered not merely to gather data, but to respect and elevate Chile's journalistic ecosystem.

## Key Technical Achievements

| Category | Result |
|----------|--------|
| Sources Integrated | 16 news outlets across TV, radio, and digital |
| Embeddings Generated | >50,000 semantic vectors |
| Similarity Search Latency | < 200 ms average |
| Concurrent Jobs | 30+ parallel scraping threads |
| Frontend Build | Type-safe React 19 SPA with SSR |
| Deployment | Continuous integration via Laravel Forge |
| Ethics Compliance | 100% adherence to robots.txt + source attribution |

## Why It Matters

Beyond news aggregation, Nuestros Tiempos is a blueprint for intelligent content analysis.
It demonstrates how AI, vector databases, and modern full-stack design can converge to make large-scale textual ecosystems both explorable and transparent.

For Codisans, this project validated a repeatable pattern:

**🧠 AI + Web Engineering + Ethical Design = Systems that create clarity at scale.**

This same architecture can be adapted for:

- Corporate intelligence dashboards (monitoring brand or sentiment).
- Academic research portals (automated literature clustering).
- Media transparency tools in other markets.
