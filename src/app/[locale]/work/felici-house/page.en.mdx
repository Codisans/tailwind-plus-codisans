## Overview
Felici House approached Swid Studio with a clear creative brief: bold, impactful, and content-first. Swid crafted a striking visual direction — our job at Codisans was to bring it to life with precision, speed, and flexibility.

## Our Role
We developed a fully custom CMS website using Statamic, giving Felici House full control over their content with no design limitations. The site was built to elevate their work — clean layouts, seamless performance, and intuitive editing workflows.

## Collaboration
Our partnership with Swid Studio allowed for a seamless handoff from design to development. They pushed the creative — we ensured nothing got lost in translation. The result is a high-impact site that loads fast, looks sharp, and is effortless to manage.
