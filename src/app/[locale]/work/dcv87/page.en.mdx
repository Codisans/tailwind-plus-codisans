## Overview
Lucien Clarke — world-renowned skateboarder and creative — approached us with a bold ambition: to launch DCV’87, a premium streetwear brand with a bespoke online experience that matched his distinctive style and creative vision. This wasn’t about selling products; it was about building culture, identity, and aesthetic impact.

Together with our design partner Swid Studio, we helped Lucien shape and ground his creative ideas into a high-performance, fully custom headless storefront — a digital space that doesn’t just showcase his brand, but lives and breathes it.

## The Creative Direction
Swid Studio, known for their design precision and cultural sensibility, led the brand’s digital identity, crafting a striking visual language and user interface that reflected DCV’87’s aesthetic — bold, gritty, and expressive.

They handled:
- Visual direction and UI design
- Brand-aligned layout structures
- Creative strategy to translate Lucien’s ideas into functional web elements

Swid brought creative clarity. Codisans brought it to life.

## The Technical Challenge
Lucien didn’t want a store — he wanted a digital extension of his creative world. But traditional Shopify themes couldn’t support:

A fully bespoke visual experience

Seamless content and product management in one place

A blog with the same artistic flexibility as the storefront

Optimized performance for product drops and mobile users

We needed to break the mold without breaking the workflow.

## The Solution
We developed a headless Shopify storefront using Shopify Hydrogen, combining Swid Studio’s custom designs with cutting-edge technology.

What Codisans delivered:
- **Custom-Built Storefront** - Every component was crafted from scratch — no templates, no constraints. This allowed us to mirror Swid Studio’s creative vision pixel for pixel, creating a brand-first digital experience.
- **Unified CMS with Shopify** - To keep Lucien’s workflow simple and efficient, we extended Shopify’s backend to also manage blog content, landing pages, and site copy — all from the same dashboard he uses to manage products.
- **Seamless Blog Integration** - The blog isn’t an afterthought — it’s a curated space for storytelling, visually aligned with the rest of the brand experience.
- **Performance Optimized, Drop-Ready** - Built on Hydrogen and hosted with Shopify Oxygen, the site is lightweight, scalable, and ready for exclusive product drops and high traffic surges.

## Results

- **Lucien’s Creative Vision — Online** - The final product is exactly what Lucien envisioned: bold, minimal, immersive, and fast. The site doesn’t just reflect the brand — it feels like it.
- **Content & Commerce — Unified** - Lucien can now manage everything — from product drops to blog posts — within one unified backend. No technical complexity, no platform juggling.
- **Powerful Creative Partnership** - The collaboration between Swid Studio and Codisans allowed Lucien to focus on creativity, while the tech and UX seamlessly supported his needs behind the scenes.

## Takeaway
DCV’87 is a powerful example of how visionary design and expert engineering can come together to produce more than just an eCommerce site — this is a creative platform.

At Codisans, we partner with agencies like Swid Studio to build flexible, branded digital ecosystems that empower creators, not limit them.
