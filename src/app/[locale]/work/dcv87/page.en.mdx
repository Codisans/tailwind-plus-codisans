## Overview

Lucien approached us looking to build out their own Shopify store. He's a hugely creative person who had a clear vision for what he wanted to achieve. A shopify template wasn't going to cut it.

We built a custom Shopify store using Shopify Hydrogen, allowing us to harness Shopify's user friendly store admin for Lucien to launch a store for his new clothing line.
