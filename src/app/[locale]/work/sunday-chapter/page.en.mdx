## Overview

Our strategic partner, Swid Studio, was approached by The Sunday Chapter, a creative talent-management agency, to refresh their digital presence. They needed a site that felt elevated and contemporary, but also easy to maintain without developer help.

We built a fully custom solution using Statamic on top of Laravel, giving them a flexible CMS with a polished front-end that matches their premium brand.

## What We Built

A flexible content system.

Everything on the site — talent profiles, partnerships, pages, media — is fully editable in Statamic. The client can add new talent, update bios, publish new pages, and adjust layout components directly from the CMS.

### A refined, modern front-end

The design focuses on clarity and strong visual storytelling:

- a clean talent grid

- elegant brand-collaboration highlights

- minimal UI with confident typography

- smooth page transitions and well-structured content blocks

The end result communicates the agency’s identity without getting in the way of the work they represent.

## Built for growth

Using Laravel underneath Statamic keeps the project extensible. As their business expands — more talent, case studies, editorial content, campaign pages — the site can grow with them. Editors stay in control, while developers get a solid foundation for future features.

## The Outcome

The Sunday Chapter now has a site that:

- looks sharp and aligns with their creative direction

- allows non-technical staff to update everything

- gives them a scalable platform rather than a fixed template

It’s a good example of how we approach CMS builds: thoughtful architecture, smooth editing experience, and front-end execution that feels crafted rather than generic.
